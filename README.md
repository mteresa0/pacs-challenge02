# Second challenge - PACS
Second challenge of the course Advaced Programming for Scientific Computing, 23/24, Politecnico di Milano.

## Installation 
To clone the repository run:
```
git clone git@github.com:mteresa0/pacs-challenge02.git
```

## Usage
First, you have to set `PACS_ROOT` as your path to the [pacs-examples]() repo. You could edit the `Makefile`; for example:
```
PACS_ROOT=/home/myname/pacs/Examples/
```

Alternatively, you may set an environmental variable with the same name using the command 
```
export PACS_ROOT=/home/myname/pacs/Examples/ 
```
Then, you should be able to compile correctly. 

In the terminal run:
- `make all` to compile and run the program;
- `make main` to compile;
- `make run` to run the program.
